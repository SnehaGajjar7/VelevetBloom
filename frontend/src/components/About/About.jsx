        <h2>“Elegant blooms. Thoughtful moments. Velvet Bloom.”</h2>

        <p>
          At Velvet Bloom, each petal whispers a memory, each bouquet cradles a
          story. We don’t just arrange flowers — we craft expressions of love,
          joy, and quiet beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rooted in nature and wrapped in elegance, our blooms are a soft
          reminder that even the simplest moments can blossom into something
          unforgettable.
